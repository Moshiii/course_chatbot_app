In SI units,  (c)If your answer to (b) is also negative, can the impeller diameter be changed to operate efficiently and still run at 1750 rev/min?   inches Ans(c.) This is approximately correct. Check: the pump head i s 22.4 m(74 ft) and flow rate is 497 gal/min. For this flow rate, the pipe head loss is 22.3 m (73 ft). NOTE: Part (c) is almost independent of n . For example, if n =20 rev/s, the best efficiency converges to an impeller diameter of 0,24 m (9.45 in), with Q 323 gal/min and Fig. Chap 11: Basic Principle s and History of Industrial Pumps https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWachJNuxSU"}, {"page_number": 8, "text": "Breast Pump : Ameda:History of the Breast Pump https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2U0s5D8maNk&ab_channel=MyAmeda"}, {"page_number": 12, "text": "Piping system characteristic curve to intersect pump char. curve at or near BEP to have an efficient pumping system.
