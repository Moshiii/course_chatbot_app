(a)Can this pump operate efficiently when delivering water at 20\u00b0C through 200 m of 10-cm-diameter smooth pipe? Neglect minor losses. (b)If your answer to (a) is negative, can the speed n be changed to operate efficiently? (c)If your answer to (b) is also negative, can the impeller diameter be changed to operate efficiently and still run at 1750 rev/min?\n(a)Can this pump operate efficiently when delivering water at 20\u00b0C through 200 m of 10-cm-diameter smooth pipe? Neglect minor losses.\nFor water at , \nConvert to SI units: \nCompute Red and f:\n\n(a) Now compute the friction head loss at 850 gal.min and see if it matches the pump head:\n\n\n\n(b) If your answer to (a) is negative, can the speed  be changed to operate efficiently? \nAt BEP, (gH/n2D2) is constant, therefore pump head is proportional to n2.  But the pipe friction loss is also approximately proportional to n2.  Thus, for any speed n, the pipe head will always be about twice as large as the pump head and not operate efficiently\n\n(c)If your answer to (b) is also negative, can the impeller diameter be changed to operate efficiently and still run at 1750 rev/min?\nThis time the answer is Yes. First note the BEP dimensionless parameters, = 1750/60=29.2 rps:\n\nNow combine these with that fact that hf is approximately propotional to n2. In SI units, \n\n(c)If your answer to (b) is also negative, can the impeller diameter be changed to operate efficiently and still run at 1750 rev/min?\n\ninches Ans(c.)\nThis is approximately correct. Check: the pump head is 22.4 m(74 ft) and flow rate is 497 gal/min. For this flow rate, the pipe head loss is 22.3 m (73 ft).\nNOTE: Part (c) is almost independent of n. For example, if n =20 rev/s, the best efficiency converges to an impeller diameter of 0,24 m (9.45 in), with Q323 gal/min and \nFig. Chap 11:\nBasic Principles and History of Industrial Pumps\n\n\nBreast Pump: Ameda:History of the Breast Pump\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPiping system characteristic curve to intersect pump char. curve at or near BEP to have an efficient pumping system. \n\nFig 11.10\n\nGiven curve by CQ\nFigure 11.8\n\n\n\nEuler\u2019s turbomachine equation\n\n"}]}
