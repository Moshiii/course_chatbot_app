2. Discussion of different types of pumps and their characteristics 
3. Best Efficient Operating point (BEP) for pumps 

Sec 11.1
Pumps:
Positive Displacement Pump (PDP)- pushes the liquid by compressing it against a cavity, with an opening suddenly becoming available.
Rotodynamic Pump(RP): Pushes the fluid by adding momentum to it by means of a fast moving blade
PDP advantage: 
works with any liquid (viscos or not, Newtonian or not)
has constant (almost) flow for any system head
PDP disadvantage:
usually low Q
pulsating/unsteady flow (unless a settlement tank is used)
RD advantage:
steady flow
high flow rates compared to PDP
variable flow depending on the system head
RD diasvantages:
Needs “priming” unlike PDP. Priming means that the pump needs to be filled with liquid to start, i,e, to suck liquid
Moderate pressure
High viscous liquids (or shear thickening) will degrade the pump performance, significantly.

Types of Pump Video:


Video for working Centrifugal Pump:


Good video to watch to understand how different pumps work!


See Figs. 11.1-11.3 & 11.6 & 11.7 & 11.3

Fig 11.6 7 11.7:
Pump curves are strictly for a given fluid
At low  Const. (but pump is inefficient)
Max  is at  0.6
Max  point is called BEP (Best Efficiency point) and one should aim for running the pump at BED.
